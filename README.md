This is one of the first "Complex" example i'm doing while learning C#.

The program fetches info about Serie A's italian football competition from a file, like it would do with a database.
It stores it and does some manipulations.

The data i got was super messy. I used python to manipulate it and put it in a way i could read better with C#. Everything about that is not perfect and i also did some changes with a notepad. Still does the job for me.

All of this was done in the first week of learning C#, on the second day of my stage at 2S.I. Software. Thanks for the help to them.
