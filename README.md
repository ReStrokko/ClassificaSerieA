--This is one of the first "Complex" example i'm doing while learning C#.

The program fetches info about Serie A's italian football competition from a file, like it would do with a database.It stores it and does some manipulations.

The data i got was super messy. I used python to manipulate it and put it in a way i could read better with C#. Everything about that is not perfect and i also did some changes with a notepad. Still does the job for me.

All of this was done in the first week of learning C#, on the second day of my stage at 2 S.I. Software. Thanks for the help to them.


--This next push is about the state of the code at the end of the day. The feature i wanted to implement are done. There is only a bug about points gained wich do not match to the official leaderboard. I'm debugging it as I write this the next morning.
A feature i'd like to implement if there's any spare time is the option to have a JSON file, much like a noSQL database where i can store the data for further use.

--This is probably the last push i'll do about this mini-project. There's still a mini-bug about one single match not being counted but i haven't been able to find the culprit of it. Probably some small random thing. This whole project took, about a working day and a half. I dont really like how long it took but i still learned a lot about C# and I've been able to look at Python code, I really don't want to forget that language for personal use. Still, 12 hours on and off is a lot but I'm hopefull i can get faster and write better code (this one is really messy and I'm sorry for whoever tries to read it).
